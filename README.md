# Tech Job Visualizer

Welcome to Tech Job Visualizer!
This project analyzes tech industry job data and creates simple visualizations of trends like top job titles, in-demand skills, and salary insights.

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to practice:

    Data handling and exploration with Python

    Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

    Clean coding practices and project organization

    Git version control and GitHub portfolio presentation

## Tech Stack:

    Python 3.x

    pandas (for data analysis)

    matplotlib (for plotting)

    seaborn (for prettier graphs)

## Project Structure:

tech_job_visualizer/

    data/ (Raw data files, CSV)

    images/ (Saved graph images)

    src/ (Python scripts)

    README.md (Project documentation)

    requirements.txt (Python libraries needed)

    .gitignore (Files to ignore in Git)

## Visualizations Created:

    Top 10 most common tech job titles

    Top 10 most requested tech skills

    Average salary by role and/or location

(Visuals are saved inside the images/ folder.)

## How to Run:

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tech_job_visualizer.git

    cd tech_job_visualizer

    Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the main script:

    python src/your_script_name.py

## Future Improvements:

    Fetch live data from APIs (like LinkedIn or Indeed APIs)

    Build an interactive dashboard (e.g., with Plotly, Streamlit)

    Add filtering options (e.g., by location, by salary range)

## Acknowledgments:

    Inspired by open tech datasets from Kaggle and GitHub repositories.

    Created to sharpen Python, data analysis, and visualization skills.
